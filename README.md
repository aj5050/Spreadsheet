# Spreadsheet functionality overview
Jan 11th: Currently setting up GitHub, README files, and analyzing the assignment. Added all files up until instruction 6 on the "Assignment One - Formula Evaluator" Google doc. I added the "FormulaEvaluatorTester" project
with it's FrameWork set to net 8.0, since I couldn't add it as a 6.0 as instructed. 
<br>Jan 13th: Added additional README file for the FormulaEvaluatorTester program. Added stacks for operators and values, delegates and methods, and finished the first 2 conditions of the evaluator method (the substring is an integer
or a stack)
<br>Jan 15th: Finished the rough draft of the Evaluator, writing test code for debugging. Figured out that the project type was incorrect, fixed it very painfully. Debugged code after running very basic test, addition works now.
<br>Jan 16th: Wrote more tests for the evaluator, used String's .Trim() method to get rid of whitespace leading and trailing. Added 2 private helper methods for integer tokens and operator tokens. Dividing by zero now throws an exception
<br>Jan 17th: Filled out the XML comments. Currently working on the delegate method. Figured out I didn't need to work on the delegate method, wrote more exceptions for Formula Evaluator (like if the valueStack is empty). Any "" token is now ignored.
Both stacks now reset upon running the evaluator method.
