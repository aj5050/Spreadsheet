# Spreadsheet functionality overview
	Jan 11th: Currently setting up GitHub, README files, and analyzing the assignment. Added all files up
	until instruction 6 on the "Assignment One - Formula Evaluator" Google doc. I added the
	"FormulaEvaluatorTester" project with it's FrameWork set to net 8.0, since I couldn't add it as a 6.0
	as instructed. 
	Jan 13th: Added additional README file for the FormulaEvaluatorTester program. Added stacks for
	operators and values, delegates and methods, and finished the first 2 conditions of the evaluator
	method (the substring is an integer or a stack)
	Jan 15th: Finished the rough draft of the Evaluator, writing test code for debugging. Figured out that
	the project type was incorrect, fixed it very painfully. Debugged code after running very basic test,
	addition works now.
	Jan 16th: Wrote more tests for the evaluator, used String's .Trim() method to get rid of whitespace
	leading and trailing. Added 2 private  helper methods for integer tokens and operator tokens. Dividing
	by zero now throws an exception
	Jan 17th: Filled out the XML comments. Currently working on the delegate method. Figured out I didn't
	need to work on the delegate method, wrote more exceptions for Formula Evaluator (like if the
	valueStack is empty). Any "" token is now ignored. Both stacks now reset upon running the evaluator
	method.
	----------------------------------
	Jan 18th: Added some files for assignment 2, still need to add README files and "Extension" project
	Jan 19th: Updated/Formated README files
	Jan 23rd: Added Extension Library, filled all methods up to "RemoveDependency" in DependencyGraph.
	Adjusting methods using new Dictionary. All methods adjusted, ran tests, completed pre-tests, need to
	add more.
	Jan 24th: Added Assignment 1 auto-grader tests, fixed bugs that were present in Evaluator.cs. Added
	more tests to DependencyGraphTests.
	Jan 25th: Added additional tests, fixed bugs presented by additional tests. Got rid of unnecessary
	for loops in methods like
	GetDependents/Dependees. Added some more conditions to prevent bugs, wrote comments, finished first
	draft.
	----------------------------------
	Jan 29th: Added the Formula.cs API, read through instructions.
	Jan 30th: Added test file for Formula.cs, added README files for both classes, added helper methods
	to Extensions (need to add header comment and README file), implemented parsing rules for Formula
