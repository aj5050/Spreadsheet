# Comments to Evaluators:
    There isn't a whole lot of comments for the test methods because they are all so short, so instead I commented the different sections of what I am testing (i.e. Formula Constructor, Evaluator, etc.)
    and added "see title" comments

# Assignment Specific Topics
    I didn't find any specific topics to write about on this assignment.


# Consulted Peers:

    I talked with a T.A. but I didn't catch her name.
