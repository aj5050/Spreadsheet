# Comments to Evaluators:
    I had to set up a new file because I made the Formula Evaluator a Console Application instead of a Library, so if there are any additional files name Formula Evaluator that's what happened. Also I added 3 private helper methods, two are just code that was used often, and one is to check if a string is a variable or not. 

# Assignment Specific Topics
    I didn't find any specific topics to write about on this assignment.
